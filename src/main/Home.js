    <h3>At the current moment, this website is a bit empty and lonely.</h3>
    <h3>But not to worry! I'll update this site as I become more and more experienced!</h3>
    <h3>Don't you think its nice, a website which grows and develops with its owner?</h3>
    <h3>It's like my own special place</h3>
    <h3>Especially since not many people will be visiting this site, wonder if Google will even find it?</h3>
    <br/>
    <h3>Well that's enough talk I guess</h3>
    <h3>If you ever need anything, please don't hesitate in sending an email:) Thanks!</h3>
